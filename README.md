# Project Snake

Demo - [Demo Link](https://project-snake.darkknight.in)

The idea is to learn game development. I will be using the classic snake game as a base template for this entire experimentation. I will keep building different versions of the snake game, as I keep proceeding with different platforms.

## Version 1 - This is a classic snake game built on `REACT + TYPESCRIPT + VITE`.

1. Install dependencies - `npm run build`
2. Run in local machine - `npm run dev`
3. Build the project - `npm run build`

## Features Coming Soon

1. Settings menu.
2. Saving game state and provide a continue option.

## Features Available

1. Works with keyboard
2. Works with joystick/controller
3. Works with mobile swipe
